# Tenant Safety (StoreTrack)

## Invariants

- `request.business` is the request tenant.
- Top-level tenant data normally inherits `BusinessOwnedModel`.
- Request views use scoped `.objects`, never `.raw_objects`.
- New BusinessOwnedModel rows are assigned `request.business` server-side.
- A submitted object ID is not trusted until re-queried through a tenant-scoped
  queryset.
- Cross-business superuser operations must be explicit and permission checked.
- Business-local Order numbering never substitutes for the globally unique DB
  primary key in URLs/FKs.

## Review procedure

For every changed queryset, ask:

1. What tenant does this query execute under?
2. Can a user alter a POST/GET ID to fetch another business's object?
3. Is a related child implicitly scoped through a verified parent?
4. Does an export/report use the same business scope as the screen?
5. Does superuser behavior intentionally differ from Business Admin behavior?

Flag accidental global access as a correctness/security bug, not a UI issue.
